I maked the submission files that are required but yeah

Compression Algorithm:

If the number of files requested does not evenly divide into the length of the string, the remaining leftover length is added to the first file. For example, a string of length 11 divided into three files would result in the strings to be compressed into 5 3 3.
Numerical characters result in a warning message printed out.
Whitespace is skipped (by Professor Francisco's spec).
Output is in the form of .txt files.

Threaded Implementation
compressT_LOLs.c

To call the threaded implementation of LOLS, it is assumed that the user is working in terminal. Compile compressT_LOLS.c.
Input format should be filename, # of files wanted. 
Ex: ./a.out fileToBeCompressed.txt 3
