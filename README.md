I maked the submission files that are required but yeah

compressT_LOLs.c

breaks up the string to be compressed by taking in the user input, then distributing the remaining length n to the first n files
ie, string length 5, user input 2 files -> 5%2 = 1, string length compress is 3, 2

didn't add checking for weird characters yet, idk how to handle it. will scour piazza later

some simple test cases:
uneven string length distribution (length = 5, 2 files, etc)
when only wants 1 file output - > makes file with LOLs and no number afterwards

need to do:
spaces/non alpahabets for compression algorithm part
